# matrix

Matrices library in Scala

This is a small library about conducting matrix calculations in Scala and
strongly inspired by the Haskell library [Data.Matrix](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/matrix-0.3.6.1/docs/Data-Matrix.html)

The only dependency we rely on is [Scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz)
